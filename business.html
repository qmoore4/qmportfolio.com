        This business page was created in a attempt to start my pursuit into entrepreneurship. 
        The idea came about through my hobby in smoothie making, this is better explained in Fig.1. 
        Whenever I have time, I make breakfast smoothies for myself before I go to work. 
        For the project, I decided to formulate a strategy to produce smoothies to give to my co workers. 
        Huge implementations that I'm proud of, is the ordering system that was pictured in Fig.2. 
        In this picture, orders can be made through typing what you want; then hitting the submit button. 
        Afterwards I will receive an email from that submission, then go on to create their order. 
        In Fig.3 you'll witness a survey that was created to gauge the users reciprocation of the service, which follows the email tool as well.
